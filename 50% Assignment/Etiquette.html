				It is very important to effectivly cooperate with your team, if you do not, you risk the death of yourself and your team mates. While there is not much you need to know, the little you do need to know is important.

		Etiquette:<br>
		If a team mate of yours dies and drops their stratigem weapons and/or backpack, do not take it, they will want it back once they get reinforced.<br><br>
		If a team mate calls in a stratigem weapon and/or backpack and pings it, it is an invitation to take it.<br><br>
		Do not reinforce imediatly, only do so if you are close to where a team mated died, if there is nobody close to where they died, or if nobody has reinforced them for a while.<br><br>
		Do not activate the terminal on the SEAF artillery side objective, only do so if you have found all 5 rounds and placed them next to the hatch where you load them in. This is because the beeping of the terminal can attract patrols.<br><br>
		The SEAF artillery shoots the first round loaded in and then the rounds that follow, the order you should load them in at is: Mini-nuke, High Yield Explosive, Explosive, napalm, Static field, smoke.<br><br>
		Samples are shared, if someone picks one up, everyone will get them on extract.
